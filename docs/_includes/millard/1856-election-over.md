Buffalo, N.Y. Oct. 29. 1856,

My Dear Miss Stuart,

Your very welcome letter of Oct. 24th came to hand night before last, and yesterday I went to all the music stores in town to execute your order for the "\_\_ <u>Quick Step</u>" but could not find a copy. Then, and not till then, did it occur to me, that possibly it was the music which had been sent to me. I accordingly examined it and found it was and sent \[text is crossed out\] it to you last evening.

The election is approaching; and we hope for the best but I am prepared for the worst.

But whatever may be the result, I am thankful that the end is so near. I hope when it is over to have a little more leisure and certainly a little more rest for my eyes; which I can not favor as much as I ought.

The end is so near that I forbear to speculate at all upon our chances; and if defeated shall find consolation in the fact that I am relieved from a load of responsibility, & the hazard of losing what little reputation I now possess as a statesman. My philosophy is that all will be for the best.

You do not say when you will return; but be assured that we shall all be most happy to welcome you back, & none more so than \[...\]

Your friend
