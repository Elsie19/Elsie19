A. A. Mayer, Esq.
<br>
Peoria, Ills;

Sir,

I have your letter of the 13<sup><u>th</u></sup> inst. expressing your regret that I was not nominated at the Baltimore Convention, in which sentiment you are so kind as to say that thousands of others concur.  My only regret is that my friends were disappointed, but, in the language of the lamented Clay, "I would rather be right than President."

I am your obt. servt,
