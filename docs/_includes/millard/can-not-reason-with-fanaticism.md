<u>Private</u>

Buffalo, Sept. 12. 1856.

Hon. Jas. Brooks.

My Dear Sir,

I am sorry to see by the papers that you were ill; but I hope nothing serious as we can not spare you now.

You can not reason with fanaticism, and therefore the best mode of meeting the attacks upon me for signing the Fugitive Slave act is to show that the Republicans voted to extend the same act over Kansas & Nebraska.  I sent you this vote on the 8th under my frank but do not see it published. <u>What is the objection</u>?  I send another copy--  In haste

Truly yours
