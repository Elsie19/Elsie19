Washington May 25 '52

Gov. Gibbs,

My Dear Sir,

I regret not having seen you yesterday, but before I had time to open my letters, one of my secretaries came in and when I inquired for you I was surprised to learn that you had left. I have looked for you today, but my messenger informs me you have not called. I have an engagement this evening at 8 but would be happy to see you at 7 1/2.

I am truly yours
