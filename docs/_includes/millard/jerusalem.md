<u>Private</u>

Washington City,
June, 17<sup><u>th</u></sup> 1852.

My Dear Sir,

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 14<sup><u>th</u></sup> inst., accompanied by a beautiful picture of "<u>ancient Jerusalem</u>", executed, as you inform me, by the Messrs. Wunderlichs, for which I beg leave to return you my sincere thanks.  I have barely had time to glance at the picture but not to study it, nevertheless it appears to me to be very well executed and to give a very distinct idea of the appearance of the city.  No locality possesses so much interest for the christian \[sic\] community as this little spot where our Saviour performed many of his most extraordinary works and was finally crucified; and I cannot but hope that the publication may prove as profitable to the enterprising gentlemen who have undertaken it, as it will be interesting and useful to our christian \[sic\] community.

With many thanks for the kind manner in which you have been pleased to convey this little token of remembrance,

I have the honor to be
<br>
Your ob. serv.
