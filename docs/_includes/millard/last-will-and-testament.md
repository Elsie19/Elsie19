I, Millard Fillmore of the City of Buffalo in the State of New York, do make, publish and declare this my last will and testament, in manner following that is to say:

Believing that the laws of the State of New York have provided for as equitable a distribution of the little property which I am likely to leave, at my decease, as I could make by will, except that in a few particular cases, it is therefore my desire to leave its distribution and descent to the operation of law and the ante-nuptial contract existing between me and my beloved wife Caroline C., except as hereinafter expressed.

*First*. I feel it a duty and pleasure to record my dying testimony to the noble qualities of my beloved wife Caroline C., who has ever proved a kind, affectionate and devoted wife, and I hereby ratify and confirm the ante-nuptial conract between us; and wish my executors and heirs to see it fully and faithfully carried out and executed, and if she and my son Millard Powers shall both survive me, I hope and trust that they may love each other as I have loved them; as they will both be orphans, indeed, I hope also that they will mutually render to each other every assistance due from a most affectionate parent to a beloved child, and from a most affectionate and dutiful child to a beloved parent; and with this I shall rest in peace.

*Secondly*. I hereby release and bequeath unto each of my brothers, Cyrus Fillmore and Calvin T. Fillmore, all claims of every name and nature which at my decease I may have against them or either of them or their heirs or legal representatives; and I hereby authorize my executors or either of them to acknowledge the same satisfied.

*Thirdly*. I give and bequeath unto each of my sisters Olive A. Johnson and Julia Harris an annual annuity of four hundred dollars per annum during her natural life, to be paid to each of them quarter-yearly, for her sole use and benefit free from all claim or control of her husband.

*Fourthly*. I give and bequeath to my brother Calvin T. Fillmore and his wife Miranda, and the survivor of them and to his or her heirs and assigns, the farm of one hundred acres, now occupied by him in the town of Scio, Washtenaw county, Michigan, being the n. w. quarter of section number twenty-three in township no. two, south of range no. five east, excepting the east sixty acres.

*Fifthly*. I give one thousand dollars to the Buffalo Orphan Asylum, to be securely invested in bond and mortgage for the benefit of said asylum.

*Sixthly*. I leave all the rest and residue of my estate, real and personal, to the operation of the said ante-nuptial contract, which fixes and settles the rights and claims of my said wife, in and to my estate, in lieu of all other claims; and the remainder of said estate I leave to be inherited and distributed according to the laws of the State of New York, except as herin otherwise directed. But as the objects nearest my heart are my dear wife and son, I will and desire that during their joint lives they shall share equally in net income of my estate, and if after the payment of all charges thereon, including said bequests, annuities and the third due my said wife by the ante-nuptial contract, my son's share thereof shall be more than said third, then my will and desire are that the surplus be equally divided between them; and in case my wife shall survive my son, then after his death I will and desire that she shall during her natural life, receive one half of the net income of my estate without deducting from such half any part of the annuities herein granted, instead of the third as provided in said ante-nuptial contract; and I hereby, appoint my said wife Caroline C., and my said son Millard P., and my friend Nathan K. Hall, executrix and executors of this my last will and testament, hereby revoking all former wills by me made.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal at Buffalo this 8th day of December eighteen hundred and sixty-five.

MILLARD FILLMORE

A codicil, Sept. 19, 1868, increases the annuity to his sisters from $400 to $600. A second codicil, Apr. 28, 1873, gives to Calvin T. Fillmore an annuity of $500 in lieu of the farm; and also provides "that after the payment of my funeral expenses, and all just debts and the bequest to the Orphan Asylum, that all my personal property as soon as conveniently may be, be invested in United States or New York State bonds, or bonds of the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad and out of the interest accruing thereon the said annuities shall first be paid, and all taxes and assessments upon my real and personal estate whether occupied or possessed by my said wife or not, and the balance I hereby bequeath to my said wife, and direct the same to be paid to her during her natural life"; thereafter, to be disposed of under the State laws.
