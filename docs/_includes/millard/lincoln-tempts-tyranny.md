Buffalo, March 3d. 1862.

My Dear Sir,

As you are aware, I subscribed for "<u>The World</u>" out of friendship for you, and the confidence I felt in Mr. Spaulding, that it would be a high toned conservative paper.  When it veered off into Republicanism I was disappointed, but when it took upon itself the accumulated sins of the Courier, I was disgusted, and discontinued it.  But in all this my friendship for you has never changed, and although my confidence in Mr. Spaulding has been shaken, yet, I can see that men or circumstances beyond his control, may have compelled him to pursue a course which his better judgment did not approve; and from occasional extracts from the paper which I have seen of late, I am inclined to believe that it has come back on to the ground where it started, and I hope and trust that it may be the means of doing much good.  At any rate I am disposed to renew my subscription for another year, and for that purpose enclose my check for $6 -- to the order of the World.

I set so high a value upon the paper that I preserved every number with the greatest care, as a history of the times, and have had the first year neatly bound in two large volumes.  My last No. was dated August 6. 1861, and as I renew my subscription, I should like to have it date from that time and received the back numbers.  I admire very much the able and independent manner in which the World, has insisted upon maintaining the public credit, and resisted the abolition attemps \[sic\] to destroy the Constitution & prevent a reunion of the states, by perverting this war into a war for emancipation -- and for rebrobating \[sic\] fuly \[sic\] the great outrage upon liberty and law, in arresting and imprisoning men in the loyal states without <u>warrant of law</u>.  The patience with which this has been submitted to, shows that our people are nearly prepared to receive a master, and submit to a tyrant.  It makes my blood boil to think of it.  But enough!

I am as ever your friend
