Buffalo, May. 16. 1863.

To his Excellency
<br>
Abraham Lincoln,

My Dear Sir,

On the 30th day of November 1861, you honored a nephew of mine, George M. Fillmore with a commission as 2nd Lieut. in the 3rd U.S. Artillery, and on the 28th of February 1862, he was promoted to a 1st Lieutenancy; and after serving in California and New Mexico, he was recently ordered to join his company in S. Carolina, where he had been but a short time when he received an order from your Excellency dismissing him for alleged intemperance and inefficiency. If I believed the charges true, I should not utter a word of complaint, but commend the act; but he brings me a letter from Capt. Hamilton who is the commander of the company strongly discrediting them, and he assures me they are not true, and says he can disprove them if he can be restored so as to have a court of inquiry. Knowing as I do the pressure of business not only upon you but also upon the Departments, I venture to ask as a matter of justice that he may have an opportunity to show his innocence, which if he fails to do, I shall most cheerfully acquiesce in his dismissal.

I am in great haste

your obt. servant
