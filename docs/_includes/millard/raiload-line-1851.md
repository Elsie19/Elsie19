Washington May 8. '51

My Dear Sir,

I have your note of yesterday and in reply would state that my wife, son & daughter will go north with me, but probably to avoid the crowds, will take the cars & go directly through on Monday. They will stop at the Irving House, and I shall stay over at Philadelphia, and would choose to go with my family to the Irving House. I am greatly obliged to you for your kind attention in this matter, and for your proffered arrangements to accommodate my family in going West. I desire as little display & ceremony on my account as possible. The more quiet the better I shall be satisfied.

I am truly yours
