Mrs. L. M. Greeley

My Dear Madam

Accept my thanks for a copy of "<u>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</u>" which you were so kind as to send me on leaving Washington.  I have only found time to glance at it, and see that it is a work of fiction on the “<u>vexed</u>” Subject of Slavery, \[sic\]  Mrs. F. however has read some chapters, and is much pleased with its Style and interested in its story.

This question of Slavery may well command the pens and sympathies of the fair sex, as it does the deep and anxious reflection of every Statesman in the Country. It presents a problem which time only can solve. Who can penetrate the dark future, & say whether this ever=disturbing \[sic\] subject may not send this Union asunder. Whether the war of races may not result in the final overthrow and extermination of the weaker; or whether by wise and brilliant counsels the bonds of the slave may not be gradually relaxed and as they drop off, the blackman [sic] find a home in his native Africa, and bear with him to that benighted region the blessings of Christianity and civilization. I confess that I can not look without apprehension to the future, but I hope for the best, and am ever

Sincerely your friend
