# Table of Contents

* auto-gen TOC:
{:toc}

I *really* like Millard Fillmore, and I think it's a shame that people have to go to bespoke websites to find anything written by him, so I want to make this as a document containing *anything* I can get my hands on about him!

Please don't cite this page yourself, I will provide citations at the bottom for you go get this information for yourselves.

I will at some points add my own annotations linking to other websites that may explain what he was talking about. I will also put stars on items that I believe are important to know.
