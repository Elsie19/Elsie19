My name is Elisabeth (Elsie) and I work on [Pacstall](https://pacstall.dev) among other things, but that's the main one. I started programming when I was 8 in 2013. I mainly program in Rust, but I also know Bash, C, and Java. This is my blog where I kinda just put my ramblings so yeah have fun and don't take what I say too seriously.
