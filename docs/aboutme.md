Hey, hola, χαίρετε, ᚹᛁᛚᚳᚢᛗᛖ! I'm Elisabeth (Elsie) and this is my blog!

You probably know me from either [Pacstall](https://pacstall.dev) or [Rhino Linux](https://rhinolinux.org). I created pacstall and am currently the benevolent dictator for life on it, and for Rhino Linux, I coordinate the integration between RL and Pacstall, along with being the creator and main developer for RPK (Rhino Pkg), the universal package manager wrapper.

I started programming when I was 8 in 2013 when my dad got my a Raspberry Pi Model B so I could play Minecraft on. I quickly found out that an RPi's Minecraft version was *not* Java Edition, but I didn't complain and started trying to tinker with this computer I had. I created tiny scripts with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) that would place blocks into my Minecraft world, and would also play around with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/download/scratch2), trying to make Pokémon knock-offs and whatever I felt like doing.

I'm currently a college student majoring in Computer Science and Spanish, but I'm also interested in Ancient Greek and languages in general. I mainly program in Rust, but I also know Bash, C, and Java. This is my blog where I kinda just put my ramblings so yeah have fun and don't take what I say too seriously 😉💖.
